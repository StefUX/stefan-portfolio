          I conducted extensive research on theoretical findings about the
          educational psychology of learning. In this field, one author
          Zimmerman points out with his model of self-regulated learning.

                  This is also known as a planning phase, where learners set
                  achievable short- or long-term goals, choose strategies that
                  best address the pursue of those goals, and assess their
                  beliefs and interest in the learning environment.

                  examine their satisfaction with the learning tasks. Feedback
                  from this self-reflection phase will then apply to the start

          Self-regulated learning is a cyclical process, wherein the student
          plans for a task, monitors their performance, and then reflects on the
          outcome. The cycle then repeats as the student uses the reflection to
          adjust and prepare for the next task.

          I discovered another two university researchers that dealt with
          applying Zimmermans self-learning model in online learning platforms,
          Rebecca Cheng, Ph.D. and Iris Poon. They applied the self-learning
          model on two different e-learning platforms:
          <strong>Duolinguo</strong> and <strong>Codeacademy</strong>. By
          analyzing both findings I managed to get insight and define the must

        <h3>Challenging the theoretical findings</h3>
        <p>
          To challenge the theoretical findings, I made a questionnaire covering
          the applications functionalities that based on the Zimmermans model
          are necessary for success. In demographic aspect, I targeted the
          primary <strong>target audience</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High School students (Senior preferred), but not limited to.</li>
          <li>
            23-28 yo’s looking to change their careers (trial & error before
            taking a path)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          30 high-school students answered the questionary. I summarized the
          following findings (hypothesis) :

            <p>
              The learning process follows a 7-day learning model. Each day the
              user gets a different type of lesson, collecting experience points
              in the process that helps them rank higher on the global
              leaderboard.

          <p>
            Once selected, the user has an option to start the quiz or watch a
            lesson. Watching a lesson isn’t obligatory, but gives additional
            points and for gamification purposes it stimulates loyal user to
            watch short video tutorials.

            knowledge transfer. This example shows answers chosen from 4
            different pictures and the outcomes. Then I introduced the popular
            tinder swipe (left or right) which is very familiar to our target
            users and good for the learnability of the overall app.

            <p>
              With the success stories blog posting I target the indecisive and
              self-doubt users. With the questionnaire, I found that our user
              persona has trouble with initially starting and choosing a future
              career path or change. In this way, I want to encourage them by
              showing good examples of ordinary people from their demographic
              group.

          Once completed with a fully clickable high-fidelity prototype I went

          opinions while interacting with the interface. I shortly explained the
          purpose of the research to my user tester. I gave him a scenario
          starting point and I stressed that talking loudly and explaining the
          reasoning behind every click is crucial and from that moment I stopped
          talking. Here I defined the pain points of my current design which
          need to be addressed in the future:

          Once finished with the testing, the user-tester was given a
          10-question System Usability Scale (SUS) to answer. The result was 82
          points with an acceptability range of 80. The reason I decided to go
          with the SUS was to determine whether I am following the user-centered
          design principles and going in line with the user needs.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Sustainable e-learning systems are dependent on competent
          self-regulated learners. On the other hand, applying Zimmerman’s
          self-regulated learning model in an e-learning system can teach
          self-regulation and guide students’ work by instilling the process of
          planning, practicing, evaluating, and adjusting. This in turn allows
          students to assume full control and accountability for their learning.
          For the purpose of this project, I implemented the well accepted
          functionalities and gamification methods that Duolinguo uses, in order
          to reduce the application learnability time, reduce the users
          cognitive load and create an intuitive and user-friendly design. Once
          on the website, the user won’t be bothered with learning how to use
          the app, his only focus will be the actual learning which is our
          primary objective.
