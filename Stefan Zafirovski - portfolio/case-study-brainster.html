        <p>
            Being a student at Brainster UX/UI Academy, I was given an individual assignment to create a mobile app for their e-learning program in November 2021. Over the period of one month, I researched, designed and prototyped a mobile app as an additional channel to convert users to our UX/UI Design bootcamp, so users could properly go through the full Brainster learning experience.

        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>As this was my first individual project, I made a tight schedule including user research, journey map, problem definition, brainstorm, prototype, business model and pitch preparation. Due to the time limitation, we did not get the chance to conduct the usability tests and iterate, but we would definitely include those process in the future steps.</p>

        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>I conducted an extensive research in theoretical findings about educational psychology of learning. In this field, one author Zimmerman points out with his model of self-regulated learning.
        </p>
        <h4>Self-learning model </h4>
        <img src="./tools/images/research-process.svg" alt="">
        <p>Self-regulated learning is a cyclical process, wherein the student plans for a task, monitors their performance, and then reflects on the outcome. The cycle then repeats as the student uses the reflection to adjust and prepare for the next task. </p>
        <p>The forethought phase: This is also known as a planning phase, where learners set achievable short- or long-term goals, choose strategies that best address a pursue those goals, and assess their beliefs and interest to the learning environment.
            The performance phase: Learners implement strategies to make ongoing adjustments in order to progress towards their goals via self-monitoring and self-control.
            The self-reflection phase: Learners evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and examine their satisfaction on the learning tasks. Feedback from this self-reflection phase will then apply to the start of the next SRL cycle.

        </p>
        <span class="mid-text-decoration"></span>
        <p>I discovered another two university researchers that dealt with applying Zimmermans self-learning model in online learning platforms, Rebecca Cheng, Ph.D. and Iris Poon.They applied the self-learning model on two different e-learning platforms: Duolinguo and Codeacademy. By analyzing both findings I managed to get insight and define the must haves in my application:</p>

            To challenge the theoretical findings, I made a questionnaire covering the applications functionalities that based on the Zimmermans model are necessary for success.
            In demographic aspect, I targeted the primary target audience that was given in the brif.  30 high-school students answered the questionary. I summarized the following findings (hypothesis) :

            Once completed with with a fully clickable high-fidelity prototype I went for a user testing scenario to find out eventual flaws in the design or the flow.
            I used the Loop11 online tool for user testing. Thinking aloud method was determined in order to stimulate the user to express loudly his opinions while interacting with the interface. I shortly explained the purpose of the research to my user tester. I gave him a scenario starting point and I stressed out that talking loudly and explaining the reasoning behind every click is crucial and from that moment I stopped talking.
            Here I defined the pain points of my current design which need to be adressed in the future:

            Once finished with the testing, the user-tester was given a 10 question System Usability Scale (SUS) to answer. The result was 82 points with acceptability range from 80. The reason I decided to go with the SUS was to determine whether I am really following the user-centered design principles and go in line with the user needs.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
    </aside>
    <main>
        <p>
            Sustainable e-learning systems are dependent on competent self-regulated learners. On the other hand, applying Zimmerman’s self-regulated learning model in an e-learning system can teach self-regulation and guide students’ work by instilling the process of planning, practicing, evaluating, and adjusting. This in turn allows students to assume full control and accountability for their learning. For the purpose of this project, I implemented the well accepted functionalities and gamification methods that Duolinguo uses, in order to reduce the application learnability time, reduce the users cognitive load and create an intuitive and user-friendly design. Once on the website, the user won’t be bothered with learning how to use the app, his only focus will be the actual learning which is our primary objective.

        <h4>Have a realistic time schedule</h4>
        <p>Due to the time limit, I did not have a chance to iterate. Nevertheless, this was my first do alone UX project in a very short deadline. Despite for the tight schedule, I went through the user research, ideation, and prototyping phases, which helped me rapidly gain a whole picture of how a product is created in the real-world industry. I must admit my work is far from perfect, but I think I managed to go by the book and create a solution that has relevant research done in logical steps.</p>
        <h4>Team members matter</h4>
        <p>
            I have been through all the pressure, the frustration, and the constraints and the many hours spent on this project. I found out, UX/UI is a team process, especialy for larger and complex projects.</p>
        <h4>Choosing the right research method is a challenge</h4>
        <p>
            I know I must always have the answer to Why? I chose this method. Although I managed to do my research in a logical steps, I still have the dilema whether different method would be more appropriate. I guess confusion fans away with experience.</p>
