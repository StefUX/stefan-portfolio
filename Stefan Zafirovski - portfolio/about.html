        <h1>A little bit about myself.</h1>
        <p>My name is Stefan Zafirovski and I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design.
            Back in my home town where I grew up I worked as a graphic designer in my familys printing company. My father is responsible for my connection with design from a very young age.
            <br>
            I received a Master's degree from Project Management program at Faculty of Electrical Engeneering in Skopje back in 2018. I wanted to relate my Master thesis with design field and that is when I first got introduced into UX design.
            I did an elaborate theoretical research on UX and got in love with this new profession. <br>

            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>It’s an integral part of my life. It’s an activity I carried on from childhood, with warm reminiscences of going place with my friends, jumping dirt mounds to tooling around town, checking out new places. It’s something I see myself doing when I’m a 100.</p>
            <h1>Running</h1>
            <p>Running takes me to places where my feet cant. It takes me to places where I can stretch both my legs and gallop till they cry out for mercy. Where I can hear my own breathing and feel every muscle in my body move. But most importantly, it takes me to places where everything kind of blurs out and I am left with nothing but my thoughts. It cleanses me, in and out.</p>
            <h1>Collecting old stuff</h1>
            <p>I love history so naturally the aesthetics of the eras always have something to like. Sometimes I love the design, sometimes I love the real wood or materials that are not plastic. Sometimes I appreciate the work and craftmanship that has gone into making an item. </p>
